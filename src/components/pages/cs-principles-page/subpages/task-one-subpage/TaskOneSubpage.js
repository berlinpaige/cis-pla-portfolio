                <h1> Identify impacts of computing on society and innovation</h1>
                <p>Computing impacts communication, interaction, and cognition. Access to all types of 
                    information facilitates the identification of problems, development of solutions, and 
                    circulation of results. Data is accessible for new discoveries to be made, online trends 
                    predict consumer and societal behaviors, sensor networks create new connections between 
                    physical items and "smart" systems. With computing, the possibilities for humans seems 
                    endless with a future more connected and the seemingly impossible, possible.</p>
                <p>My ability to take this course is a product of computing innovation. I live 1,000 miles 
                    away from the facilitating institution of this course, however, I can access information, 
                    gain knowledge, and communicate my understanding all within the realm of the virtual version 
                    of this course.</p>
                <p>The company I work for, Craftsy, makes money by providing online courses in skillful areas of crafting. 
                    The courses are provided online, yet allow instructor interaction, a platform for note-taking, 
                    and the ability to pause, rewind, slow-down, and various other controls to the way in which the 
                    content is consumed. This allows many advantages over traditional classroom learning</p>
                <p>Technology is changing the world. It is amazing to be part of the innovation, actively 
                    contributing to the advances rather than sitting on the sidelines watching the computing 
                    world pass me by</p>
