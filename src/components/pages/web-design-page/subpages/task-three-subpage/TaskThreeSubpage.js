                <p>Sometimes it can be difficult to balance the needs of the business with the needs of 
                    users. And sometimes the needs of the business start to transform the user base, leading 
                    to new discoveries about users and their needs.</p>
                <h3>Some first hand experience</h3>
                <p>My current company, Craftsy, began last year with a huge goal. The previously alla carte business 
                    of serving up class content would be transformed into a subscription service, provideing unlimited 
                    class content for a monthly fee. This endeavour proved to be a huge learning experience about business 
                    and user needs. Through the process, we discovered that the user for the alla carte business is generally 
                    a completely different user than the users attracted to our subscription service. The first user is most 
                    interested in honing a very specific type of skill, whereas the second user is a learner interested in 
                    discovering inspiring content that sparks a new passion. Because of thsi discrepancy, we learned that our 
                    business needs of gaining capitol (I'm not a business person, I think this is a fancy word for money) would 
                    be best served by not replacing old Craftsy with new Craftsy, but by maintaining both Craftsy's as a way to 
                    accomplish goals.</p>
                <p>We are still in the discovery phase of this endeavour, but we are learning a lot about our users along the way. 
                    We are discovering that on the subscription platform, community is a key area that has significantly less meaning 
                    in an alla carte environement. Therefore, we are investing time and resources to build robust methods of engagement 
                    in the unlimited site. We can then use these community pieces to drive traffic to additional money-earning areas 
                    of the site, and keep users engaged to promote continued subscriptions and world-of-mouth acquisitions.</p>

                <h2>Here are a few photos (since you can't access without a subscription) of this experience!</h2>
                <h1>Add some photos here :)</h1>
