                <p>When we create products of technology, it is often important to translate constructs 
                    that users are used to in real life into its mimicked form on screen. A common use 
                    of this in technology is tabbed navigation. Tabbed navigation mimics the tabbed 
                    folders in offices and provides context to the user that there are layers of 
                    organized information on the page.</p>
                <p>It is important to establish a website organizational structure that uses common 
                    architecture to match your usersâ€™ expectations. Some common themes are sequences, 
                    hierarchies, and webs. Sequences mimic the structure of books, magazines, and other 
                    print media. This ordering could be chronological, general to specific, alphabetical, 
                    etc. In a hierarchical structure, the site is a set of pages with a series of subpages; 
                    this is probably the most common website navigation structure. Web navigation harnesses 
                    the concept of associative thought and free-flow ideas, allowing users to jump around 
                    based on their interests.</p>
                <p>You can see websites leveraging mental models in many places: buttons, icons, and 
                    animations can be some examples. Also, as technology has become more prevalent in 
                    our lives, we begin to notice users are building mental models off of other 
                    abstracted mental models. The hamburger menu is a good example of this. While often 
                    regarded as a confusing mobile navigation option by user experience experts, it is a 
                    construct that has become ingrained in the minds of the average mobile-browsing user, 
                    a mental model of an initially incorrect mental model.</p>
                <p>Mental models in practice:</p>
                <p>There is a project I'd like to share as it relates to this topic. While this 
                    mental model is not as straightforward as something like tabs, the following 
                    project uses an interesting construct to grab attention while also serving as 
                    background noise: a screensaver.</p>
                <p>The project's goal was to mimic a screensaver while providing interesting content 
                    to employees and office guests. It was to be displayed in the lobby of each office 
                    on a large screen and played continuously throughout the work day. The content was 
                    submitted by employees with optional captions. Each piece of content displayed the 
                    submitter's home office. The piece of technology served as a way to bring people 
                    across multiple international offices together.</p>
                <p>To mimic the mental model of a screensaver, I created animation that played in a 
                    cyclical fashion. The sliding and image-growing animation give the movement that we 
                    know and love from screen savers. Additionally, the direction from which the images 
                    slide onto the viewing area are chosen at random, just like the screensavers of our 
                    youth.</p>
                <p>This was a fun mental model to play with since it has a feeling of nostalgia associated 
                    with it and isn't a boring organizational construct like most mental models we aim to 
                    recreate are.</p>
