                                and wireframes and give feedback.

                                Unlimited, fall within a similar visual style. This helps maintain the 
                                brand and by using already existing components, can speed up development 
                                time and keep the code cleaner.

                                Review the designs and create tickets for each task involved in the 
                                engineering of the site. Create estimations for the amount of time each 
                                task will require to be completed. Adjust scope if necessary (this could 
                                happen earlier on in the process as well) and determine a completion date.

                                In this case, scope may need to be adjusted in order to get a less robust 
                                version of the product out in time. Another solve could be adding 
                                additional engineers and divvying up the tasks differently. Ultimately, 
                                at this point, development is set in motion.

                                Before any code is written, an engineer should first plan out his or 
                                her approach to solving the problem. This is often an algorithm, 
                                but can also be just a plan of approach.

                                At some point in the development process (I often do this last), tests 
                                should be written to test the code you just wrote. This helps when you 
                                or someone else modifies the code in the future or builds a feature that 
                                could affect (or even break) the code you just wrote. It helps catch bugs 
                                early, hopefully before they are ever pushed to production.

                                Before launching the product, project, or feature, it is important to QA. 
                                This is sometimes done by a team separate from the team that writes the 
                                code. It can even be done by an external party.

                        Throughout many of the steps in this process, there is constant iteration. 
                        Often, a design isnâ€™t approved right away and the code is rarely bug-free on the 
                        first try. Each step requires creating something, getting feedback, then improving 
                        that creation based on the collected feedback. Sometimes, the process may even 
                        require backing up a few steps if something is discovered to be missing further 
                        down the pipeline.
