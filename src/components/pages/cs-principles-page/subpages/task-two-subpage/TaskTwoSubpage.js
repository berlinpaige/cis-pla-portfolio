                <p>A computational artifact is anything created by a human using a computer. Some examples of an 
                    artifact may be a program, image, audio, video, presentation, or webpage.</p>
                <p>My artifact of proof for this objective is this website. I created it soley for this course, 
                    however, it serves as a perfect example of "creating something using a computer". I used a 
                    computer for nearly every aspect of creation of this site from the code, to the words, to the 
                    images.</p>
