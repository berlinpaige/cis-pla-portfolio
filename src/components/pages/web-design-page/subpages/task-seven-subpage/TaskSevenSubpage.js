                <h2>*view this as a rough draft: photos, styles, and revisions are still coming</h2>

                <p>I have created many sites based on client needs throughout my career. One of
                my favorite examples of this was a simple site that I created for American Airlines</p>

                <h3>The ask: create a site for The Bonnie Award before the winner is announced</h3>

                <p>I like this example because the ask and the website are simple. The website required
                    basic information and basic navigation, which allowed for the content to be presented
                    in an aesthetically pleasing, yet elegant way.</p>

                <p>This website needed a section to play video, a description of the award, and some 
                    information about the award inspiration and sponsors. The result was a clean html5 and css3
                    (no additional libraries needed) site with a few simple links and subtle animation. 
                    See the finished product here:</p>
