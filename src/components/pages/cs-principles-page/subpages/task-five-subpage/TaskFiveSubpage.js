                <p>Abstraction reduces information and detail to facilitate focus on relevant concepts</p>
                <p>Multiple levels of abstraction are used in computation. Binary data is processed by 
                    physical layers of computing hardware, including gates, chips, and components, 
                    programming languages, from low to high level, are used in developing software, and 
                    applications and systems are designed, developed, and analyzed using levels of 
                    hardware, software, and conceptual abstractions</p>
                <p>Models and simulations use abstraction to raise and answer questions.</p>
                <p>People use models and simulations to generate new understanding and knowledge, 
                    Models use different levels of abstraction to represent phenomena. Hypotheses 
                    can be formulated, refined, and tested using models and simulations. Simulations 
                    can facilitate extensive and rapid testing of models.</p>
